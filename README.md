# Public Health AI Assistant

This is a web-based AI chatbot designed to answer health-related questions and provide general information about Mukdahan province, powered by Google's Gemini API.

## Project Setup

1.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Set up Firebase (Optional)**:
    If you want to use user authentication, chat history, and other backend features, you need to configure your own Firebase project in `services/firebase.ts`. The app will guide you if the configuration is missing.

## Local Development

To run the app locally:
```bash
npm run dev
```
This will start a development server, typically on `http://localhost:5173`.
